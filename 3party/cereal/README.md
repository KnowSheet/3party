Header-only Cereal with no dependencies and no extra ```-I``` flags required.

See [examples/cereal/message.h](https://github.com/KnowSheet/3party/blob/master/examples/cereal/message.h) for example usage.

Created from ```cereal-1.0.0.tar.gz``` by running ```gen.sh``` on Linux (MacOS has different ```sed -i``` setting, tweak by changing ```-i``` into ```-i ''```).
